		  <p>Wayne Rooney started his playing career at Everton and was promoted to the first team in 2002 at the age of 16, sitting on the reserve bench. In the warm-up match before the start of the 2002/03 season, Rooney scored 8 goals in 9 games. The first game of the season was against Tottenham at home on August 17, 2002. Rooney made his debut and was assigned to start the game, marking the beginning of Everton's 100th anniversary in the top league. On October 1, he scored twice at the end of the game against Wrexham in the League Cup, becoming the youngest goalscorer in Everton's history. On October 19, his goal against Arsenal at home broke the record for the youngest player to score in the Premier League.</p>
